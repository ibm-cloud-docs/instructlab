# Getting started with InstructLab
{: #getting-started}
{: toc-content-type="tutorial"}
{: toc-services="instructlab"}
{: toc-completion-time="30m"}

Follow these steps to prepare your account for the InstructLab tech preview.
{: shortdesc}

## Prerequisites
{: #instructlab_pre}

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

- A paid IBM Cloud account.

- A main taxonomy for the base model you want to improve. Currently, only `github.com` is supported. There is a [community repositiory](https://github.com/instructlab/taxonomy){: external} available on Github. 


## Request access
{: #instructlab_access}
{: step}

InstructLab is available on an allowlist basis. To request that your account be added to the allowlist, send an email to `instructlab@ibm.com` with the following information. You can find your account ID on the [Account settings](https://cloud.ibm.com/account/settings){: external} page. Allow 1-2 business days for the request to be processed. After you are allowlisted, you can access the InstructLab UI and CLI. 


To
```txt
instructlab@ibm.com
```
{: codeblock}

Subject
```txt
Request to allowlist account: <account_id> to use IBM Cloud InstructLab Service.
```
{: codeblock}

Body
```txt
Add account <account_id> to the allowlist for the IBM Cloud InstructLab service.
```
{: codeblock}

While you wait for you account to be added to the allowlist, you can continue on with step 2. 


## Set up {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}}
{: #instructlab_cos}
{: step}

A COS bucket is required to store all inputs and outputs used or generated by InstructLab, including the taxonomy, the synthetic generated data, and the final fine-tuned model. Follow these steps to set up a COS bucket. 

1. [Provision a COS instance](https://cloud.ibm.com/objectstorage/create){: external} in your account. 
1. Click the instance name.
1. Create a custom bucket. Specify **Resiliency** as **regional** and the **Location** as **us-east** (Washington DC).
1. In the service instance, create service credentials. Specify the **Role** as Writer and make sure HMAC credentials are included.
1. Save the `access-key-id` and `secret-access-key` of your HMAC credentials. These are used later in this tutorial to upload your taxonomy from COS to InstructLab.

## Install the CLI plug-in
{: #instructlab_cli_install}
{: step}

1. Install [Go](https://go.dev/doc/install){: external}.

1. Clone the `ilab` CLI plug-in repo.
    ```sh
    git clone git@github.ibm.com:ibmcloud-instructlab/ilab-cli-plugin.git
    ```
    {: pre}

1. Change directories.
    ```sh
    cd ilab-cli-plugin
    ```
    {: pre}

1. Install the plug-in.
    ```sh
    make install-plugin
    ```
    {: pre}

1. Log-in to your IBM Cloud account from the CLI.
    ```sh
    ibmcloud login -a https://cloud.ibm.com --sso -r us-east -c <account_id>
    ```
    {: pre}


## Prepare your taxonomy
{: #instructlab_taxonomy}
{: step}

Follow these steps to prepare and tar the taxonomy so it can later be used to generate synthetic data. 

1. Configure the git references. Make sure the information specified in these steps is accurate. Specifying the wrong base or changed model in the taxonomy creates invalid SDG or training results. 

    1. Run the command to make the local repositories up to date with the upstream. 
        ```sh
        git pull origin main
        ```
        {: pre}
    
    2. Configure the git references. You can use the InstructLab community, or your own taxonomy. This example command uses the community taxonomy. 

        ```sh
        git clone git@github.com:instructlab/taxonomy.git
        ```
        {: pre}

        ```sh
        cd taxonomy
        git remote add example git@github.com:myorg/myrepo.git
        git remote -v   
        ```
        {: pre}

        Example output.

        ```sh
        origin	                    git@github.com:<main_taxonomy>.git (fetch)
        origin	                    git@github.com:<main_taxonomy>.git (push)
        <taxonomy_change_remote>	git@github.com:<taxonomy_change>.git (fetch)
        <taxonomy_change_remote>	git@github.com:<taxonomy_change>.git (push)
        ```
        {: screen}

        Check out the branch. 

        ```sh
        git checkout <taxonomy_change_remote>/<change_branch>
        ```
        {: pre}


2. TAR the repository. Replace `<taxonomy>` with the name of the local git folder where the taxonomy is stored. 
    ```sh
    tar -czvf taxonomy.tar.gz <taxonomy>
    ```
    {: pre}


## Upload your taxonomy from COS to InstructLab
{: #instructlab_upload}
{: step}

After you receive access to InstructLab, complete the following steps to upload your taxonomy.

1. [Upload the TAR to the COS bucket](/docs/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-upload).

1. Gather the details of your COS instance and bucket.

    The `access-key-id` and `secret-access-key` to access your COS bucket.
    :   You can find these in the **Service Credentials** tab of your COS instance.
    
    Your COS bucket name.
    :   You can find this on the **Buckets** tab of your COS instance.

    The endpoint to access your bucket.
    :   Use the public, regional endpoint. For example `s3.wdc.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud`. You can find these in the **Endpoints** tab of the COS console.
    
    The region your bucket is in.
    :   For example, `us-east`.


1. Run the `ilab taxonomy upload` command to allow InstructLab to access the taxonomy TAR file that you uploaded earlier. Include your COS bucket details and credentials.

    ```sh
    ibmcloud ilab taxonomy upload \
    --cos-bucket-information-access-key-id <id> \
    --cos-bucket-information-secret-access-key <key> \
    --cos-bucket-information-bucket <bucket_name> \
    --cos-bucket-information-endpoint s3.wdc.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud \
    --cos-bucket-information-region us-east
    ```
