# Getting started with InstructLab
{: #getting-started}
{: toc-content-type="tutorial"}
{: toc-services="instructlab"}
{: toc-completion-time="30m"}

Get ready to dive into [AI](#x3448902){: term}! InstructLab is an open source project created by IBM and Red Hat to be a cost-effective entry point into the world of [machine learning](#x8397498){: term}.
{: shortdesc}


## Prerequisites
{: #instructlab_pre}

Before you begin, make sure you have a paid IBM Cloud account.


## Get familiar with the capabilities
{: #get-familiar}
If you are new to machine learning, you are in the right place. To use InstructLab, you do not need to have any preexisting knowledge. You do not even need to have an idea for what to create yet. Let's start by just getting familiar with the larger concepts and what kinds of things you can do with the technology.

[Generative AI](#x10298052) starts with a [large language model (LLM)](#x10298052){: term}. With a prompt, these models can take large sets of data and provide a statistically probable output for that prompt. These large sets of data can be synthetic, similar to real data, but automatically generated and used as a means for training the model to get the most probable output possible.

With InstructLab, you can use an existing, pre-trained LLM compiled by a community of contributors, and then generate the synthetic data to further train the model. By incorporating IBM Cloud, you have a place to store the taxonomy, the informational structure, for the model as you modified it and train the model on an ongoing basis.


## Request access
{: #instructlab_access}
{: step}

InstructLab is available on an allowlist basis. To request that your account be added to the allowlist, send an email to `instructlab@ibm.com` with the following information. You can find your account ID on the [Account settings](https://cloud.ibm.com/account/settings){: external} page. Allow 1-2 business days for the request to be processed. After you are allowlisted, you can access the InstructLab UI and CLI. 


To
```txt
instructlab@ibm.com
```
{: codeblock}

Subject
```txt
Request to allowlist account: <account_id> to use IBM Cloud InstructLab Service.
```
{: codeblock}

Body
```txt
Add account <account_id> to the allowlist for the IBM Cloud InstructLab service.
```
{: codeblock}

While you wait for you account to be added to the allowlist, you can continue on with step 2. 


## Set up {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}}
{: #instructlab_cos}
{: step}

A COS bucket is required to store all inputs and outputs used or generated by InstructLab, including the taxonomy, the synthetic generated data, and the final fine-tuned model. Follow these steps to set up a COS bucket. 

1. [Provision a COS instance](https://cloud.ibm.com/objectstorage/create){: external} in your account. 
1. Click the instance name.
1. Create a custom bucket. Specify **Resiliency** as **regional** and the **Location** as **us-east** (Washington DC).
1. In the service instance, create service credentials. Specify the **Role** as Writer and make sure HMAC credentials are included.
1. Save the `access-key-id` and `secret-access-key` of your HMAC credentials. These are used later in this tutorial to upload your taxonomy from COS to InstructLab.

## Install the CLI plug-in
{: #instructlab_cli_install}
{: step}

1. Install the [IBM Cloud CLI](/docs/cli?topic=cli-getting-started)

1. Add the `ilab` plug-in repo.

    ```sh
    ibmcloud plugin repo-add stage https://plugins.test.cloud.ibm.com
    ```
    {: pre}

    Example output.
    ```sh
    OK
    https://plugins.test.cloud.ibm.com added as 'stage'.
    ```
    {: screen}

1. Install the plug-in.

    ```sh
    ibmcloud plugin install ilab -r stage
    ```
    {: pre}

    ```sh
    Looking up 'ilab' from repository 'stage'...
    Plug-in 'ilab 0.0.1' found in repository 'stage'
    Plug-in 'ilab 0.0.1' was already installed. Do you want to re-install it or not? [y/N] > y

    ```
    {: screen}

1. Log-in to your IBM Cloud account from the CLI.
    ```sh
    ibmcloud login -a https://cloud.ibm.com --sso -r us-east
    ```
    {: pre}


## Prepare a taxonomy
{: #instructlab_taxonomy}
{: step}

In this example, we use the InstructLab [community taxonomy](https://github.com/instructlab/taxonomy){: external}. 

1. Fork the community taxonomy repo.
    ```txt
    https://github.com/instructlab/taxonomy 
    ```
    {: codeblock}

1. Clone your fork to your local machine.
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/<my-org>/taxonomy
    ```
    {: pre}

1. Optional: Make updates to the taxonomy locally and push the changes back to your fork. Example:

    a. In your cloned fork, open the `/instructlab-taxonomy/compositional_skills/linguistics/rhyming_words/qna.yaml` file.

    b. Add another question related to rhyming words.

        ```txt
        - answer: 'Here are two rhyming words for "cave":


            1\. Brave

            2\. Gave


            '
        question: 'Give me two words that rhyme with cave

            '

        ```
        {: codeblock}

    c. Save the changes and push them to the fork.

    d. Learn more about how to modify the [taxonomy](https://github.com/instructlab/taxonomy) for the model.



## Upload your taxonomy to COS
{: #instructlab_upload}
{: step}

After you receive access to InstructLab, complete the following steps to upload your taxonomy.

1. Gather the details of your COS instance and bucket.

    The `access-key-id` and `secret-access-key` to access your COS bucket.
    :   You can find these in the **Service Credentials** tab of your COS instance.
    
    Your COS bucket name.
    :   You can find this on the **Buckets** tab of your COS instance.

    The endpoint to access your bucket.
    :   Use the public, regional endpoint. For example `https://s3.us-east.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud`. You can find these in the **Endpoints** tab of the COS console.
    
    The region your bucket is in.
    :   For example, `us-east`.


1. Run the `ilab taxonomy upload` command to allow InstructLab to access your taxonomy in COS. Include your COS bucket details and credentials.

    ```sh
    ibmcloud ilab taxonomy upload \
    --name <name> \
    --taxonomy-path-local <local-path-to-taxonomy> \
    --cos-bucket-information-access-key-id <id> \
    --cos-bucket-information-secret-access-key <key> \
    --cos-bucket-information-bucket <bucket_name> \
    --cos-bucket-information-endpoint <endpoint> \
    --cos-bucket-information-region us-east
    ```
    {: pre}

    Example command
    ```sh
    ibmcloud ilab taxonomy upload --name test --taxonomy-path-local /Users/USER/instructlab-taxonomy --cos-bucket-information-access-key-id XXX --cos-bucket-information-secret-access-key XXX --cos-bucket-information-bucket instruct-lab-bucket --cos-bucket-information-endpoint https://s3.us-east.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud --cos-bucket-information-region us-east
    ```
