# Getting started with InstructLab
{: #getting-started}
{: toc-content-type="tutorial"}
{: toc-services="instructlab"}
{: toc-completion-time="30m"}

In this tutorial, you begin by requesting access to the InstructLab tech preview. Then, you'll set up a Cloud Object Storage bucket where you'll store your first InstructLab taxonomy. Finally, you'll set up the IBM Cloud CLI and use it to connect InstructLab to your COS bucket where you can begin training your model.
{: shortdesc}


## Prerequisites
{: #instructlab_pre}

Before you begin, make sure you have a paid IBM Cloud account.


## Request access
{: #instructlab_access}
{: step}

InstructLab is available on an allowlist basis. To request that your account be added to the allowlist, send an email to `instructlab@ibm.com` with the following information. You can find your account ID on the [Account settings](https://cloud.ibm.com/account/settings){: external} page. Allow 1-2 business days for the request to be processed. After you are allowlisted, you can access the InstructLab UI and CLI. 


To
```txt
instructlab@ibm.com
```
{: codeblock}

Subject
```txt
Request to allowlist account: <account_id> to use IBM Cloud InstructLab Service.
```
{: codeblock}

Body
```txt
Add account <account_id> to the allowlist for the IBM Cloud InstructLab service.
```
{: codeblock}

While you wait for you account to be added to the allowlist, you can continue on with step 2. 


## Set up {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}}
{: #instructlab_cos}
{: step}

A COS bucket is required to store all inputs and outputs used or generated by InstructLab, including the taxonomy, the synthetic generated data, and the final fine-tuned model. Follow these steps to set up a COS bucket. 

1. [Provision a COS instance](https://cloud.ibm.com/objectstorage/create){: external} in your account. 
1. Click the instance name.
1. Create a custom bucket. Specify **Resiliency** as **regional** and the **Location** as **us-east** (Washington DC).
1. In the service instance, create service credentials. Specify the **Role** as Writer and make sure HMAC credentials are included.
1. Save the `access-key-id` and `secret-access-key` of your HMAC credentials. These are used later in this tutorial to upload your taxonomy from COS to InstructLab.

## Install the CLI plug-in
{: #instructlab_cli_install}
{: step}

1. Install the [IBM Cloud CLI](/docs/cli?topic=cli-getting-started)

1. Add the `ilab` plug-in repo.

    ```sh
    ibmcloud plugin repo-add stage https://plugins.test.cloud.ibm.com
    ```
    {: pre}

    Example output.
    ```sh
    OK
    https://plugins.test.cloud.ibm.com added as 'stage'.
    ```
    {: screen}

1. Install the plug-in.

    ```sh
    ibmcloud plugin install ilab -r stage
    ```
    {: pre}

    ```sh
    Looking up 'ilab' from repository 'stage'...
    Plug-in 'ilab 0.0.1' found in repository 'stage'
    Plug-in 'ilab 0.0.1' was already installed. Do you want to re-install it or not? [y/N] > y

    ```
    {: screen}

1. Log-in to your IBM Cloud account from the CLI.
    ```sh
    ibmcloud login -a https://cloud.ibm.com --sso -r us-east
    ```
    {: pre}


## Prepare a taxonomy
{: #instructlab_taxonomy}
{: step}

In this example, we use the InstructLab [community taxonomy](https://github.com/instructlab/taxonomy){: external}. 

1. Fork the community taxonomy repo.
    ```txt
    https://github.com/instructlab/taxonomy 
    ```
    {: codeblock}

1. Clone your fork to your local machine.
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/<my-org>/taxonomy
    ```
    {: pre}

1. TAR the repository contents. In the next section, you upload this TAR to the COS bucket you created earlier.
    ```sh
    tar -czvf taxonomy.tar.gz taxonomy
    ```
    {: pre}


## Upload your taxonomy to COS
{: #instructlab_upload}
{: step}

After you receive access to InstructLab, complete the following steps to upload your taxonomy.

1. [Upload the TAR to your COS bucket](/docs/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-upload).

1. Gather the details of your COS instance and bucket.

    The `access-key-id` and `secret-access-key` to access your COS bucket.
    :   You can find these in the **Service Credentials** tab of your COS instance.
    
    Your COS bucket name.
    :   You can find this on the **Buckets** tab of your COS instance.

    The endpoint to access your bucket.
    :   Use the public, regional endpoint. For example `https://s3.us-east.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud`. You can find these in the **Endpoints** tab of the COS console.
    
    The region your bucket is in.
    :   For example, `us-east`.


1. Run the `ilab taxonomy upload` command to allow InstructLab to access your taxonomy TAR file in COS. Include your COS bucket details and credentials.

    ```sh
    ibmcloud ilab taxonomy upload \
    --name <name> \
    --taxonomy-path <path-to-taxonomy> \
    --cos-bucket-information-access-key-id <id> \
    --cos-bucket-information-secret-access-key <key> \
    --cos-bucket-information-bucket <bucket_name> \
    --cos-bucket-information-endpoint <endpoint> \
    --cos-bucket-information-region us-east
    ```
    {: pre}

    Example command where the `taxonomy.tar.gz` is in the root of the COS bucket.
    ```sh
    ibmcloud ilab taxonomy upload --name test --taxonomy-path taxonomy.tar.gz --cos-bucket-information-access-key-id XXX --cos-bucket-information-secret-access-key XXX --cos-bucket-information-bucket instruct-lab-bucket --cos-bucket-information-endpoint https://s3.us-east.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud --cos-bucket-information-region us-east
    ```
