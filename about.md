## How it works
{: #howitworks}

Learn about using InstructLab.



Step 1. Provide a taxonomy
:   A taxonomy is a directory of diverse, human-curated data used to train an LLM. The data contains examples of new knowledge and skills for the model to learn from. You can use and contribute to an existing taxonomy, or you can create your own. For more information, see [How taxonomies are structured for {{site.data.keyword.short_name}}](/docs/instructlab?topic=instructlab-taxonomy-overview).

Step 2. Generate synthetic data
:    The information in the taxonomy is used to generate synthetic data that augments the human-provided knowledge and is used to tune the model. [Learn more about the data generation process from Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/how-instructlabs-synthetic-data-generation-enhances-llms){: external}.

Step 3. Train the model
:    The synthetic data is used to train the model in two phases: knowledge tuning and skills tuning. Knowledge tuning is training that focuses on improving the LLM's based knowledge of essential skills. Skill tuning trains the model on more specific skills required for it's intended purpose, such as responding to customer inquiries or analyzing weather trends.
